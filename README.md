- Use line-segmentation to segment text-line images from single-column, non-pictorical handwritten sanskrit manuscripts
- Use line-recognition to finetune, and make inference (recognize text content from text-line images)
- Use post-correction to finetune ByT5-Sanskrit, and make inference (make corrections to line-recogntion output)

Development of this project is continued [here](https://github.com/flame-cai/win64-local-ocr-tool), where we stitch together the line segmentation (and layout analysis), text recogntiton, and post-correction
