### Notes
- git clone https://github.com/clovaai/deep-text-recognition-benchmark.git
    - Changes to make if it doesn't work:
        - in `datasets.py`:
        - in `utils.py`:
        - in `train.py`:
        - in `create_lmdb_dataset.py`:

- recognition files needs to run from the root directory
